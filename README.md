- Meticulously analyzed patient data, selected relevant features, and performed data preprocessing. <br>
- Fine-tuned model parameters for optimal logistic regression model performance.<br>
- For the neural network model:<br>
    1. Constructed using TensorFlow and Keras.<br>
    2. Experimented with various architectures and activation functions.<br>
    3. Closely monitored training progress and adjusted hyperparameters.<br>
    
- Results: <br>
    1. Yielded a logistic regression model with a notable 92.9% accuracy.<br>
    2. Demonstrated a significant enhancement in predictive power, with the neural network model achieving an impressive 97.3% accuracy.<br>
    3. Emphasized the transformative potential of data-driven solutions in early cancer detection.<br>
